<h3>The Club</h3>
The Buller Surf Rescue Club is a summer operated team. <br>
The team is rostered for every Saturday and Sunday during the Summer Months.During Public Holidays there will also be a patrol team at the popular beaches around the town.<br>
There will be flags displayed for people to swim in between. The IRB will be out in force also. Junior team members will be rostered on with the experienced Senor team members.   
However we do a lot of pool training throughout the winter.<br> 
<section><h3> National Level</h3>
<p>We are goverened by the national Surf NZ Club.<br>
Surf Life Saving New Zealand Inc. (SLSNZ) is the national association representing 74 Surf Life Saving Clubs in New Zealand.
Around 15,000 people are members of SLSNZ. The 74 clubs are grouped for consultation and programme delivery purposes into local regions, and are supported by Surf Life Saving New Zealand staff.<br>
These new groupings were an outcome of the membership voting in a new and bold constitution in September 2009.</p>
<p>The story of Surf Life Saving New Zealand is one of extraordinary efforts to save people from the unpredictable seas.
For 60 years, that meant teams of lifeguard lifting reel and line to the beach. The reel anchored victim and rescuer together.
It also anchored itself in the culture of New Zealand lifeguard.<br>
